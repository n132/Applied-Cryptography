# Secure 2-Party Computation

## Problem(informal)
A and B want to perform a fucntion f on their data. And they don't want others to know their data.

## Types of Solution
- General-purpose, e.g. Hash
- Special-purpose, e.g. FHE

## Solutions
Most general-purpose solutions are based on 
- Full Homomorphic Encryption
- Circuit Based Solutions

# Predicate-Revealing Symmetric Encryption

Equality-revealing and Order-revealing

# Yao's Solution
GC + OT
If you want to know more about Yao's solution, just have a try to implement it:)
