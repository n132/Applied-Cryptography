# Symmetric Encryption & Block Cipher
- Do Symmetric Ciphers based on PRG and PRF satisfy IND, IND-CMA and IND-active-CMA.
- Block Cipher (understanding "block") from PRP and the security notion of BC.
- Confusion diffusion propagating  & substitution Permutation multiple rounds & s-box p-box(mixing permutation) and key-schedule; s-box is invertible; avalanche effect 
- P/S Network(AES), Feistel network(DES)(amazing invention, it can convert a non-invertible function to a invertible function)-> -or -round, -round ? and why? 
- DES Cryptoanalysis
    - small round 
    - known most useful method is exhausting, short block length is DES's weakness(birthday attack) 
- A failed try of DES
    - Increasing the key length by using double-F, Triple-F, -ey-Triple-F.
    - could be attack by Meet in the middle (so dose not satisfy IND)
- AES(--,-+, best way to attack is also exhausting)
    - Add(xor) Round Key
    - SubBytes S-box
    - ShiftRows Shift
    - MixColumns linear stransformation
- Block Cipher analysis
    - Differential cryptoanalysis 
    - Linear Cryptoanalysis
- Modes of BC
    - ECB(not even satisfies IND)
    - CBC, OFB, CTR(counter)  all satisfy IND-CMA
    - Know each one's properties.
