# 1

x/y euqals an int, gcd(x,y) = y

x are prime y is less than x, gcd(x,y)=1

# 2

It is describing Trival GCD

it is not efficient.

# 3

Same as previous, not efficient.

# 4
A,C,D are polynominal-time algorithm

# 5

Trivial Division = O(sqrt(n))
easy: one of p&q is small
hard: p ~=q

# 6
They are same problem

# 7
RSA 2048, 4096, don't use it

# 8
They are same problem

# 9-15
