# 1
Just the def
# 2
They are all random n-bit str
# 3

G1 length doesn't increase

G2 satisfies 1) can't predict 2) length increases

# 4

G1 can be predicted 

G2 satisfies 1) can't predict 2) length increases

# 5

All 4 are IND

# 6 - 7

take it carefully(feistel Transform)

# 8
Hard problem -> PRG, PRF, PRP

# 9

Not efficient + secure

# 10
if M=R, then L' =0
