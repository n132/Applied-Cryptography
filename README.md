This repo is a review of Applied Cryptography 21fall, NYU Tandon. It's a great course and make sure you have enough time if you wanna register it.

Thank my professor Giovanni so much. If you are taking his courses, do not hesitate asking questions.

# Intro

I'll take the final exam 3 days later and I'll document the important topics(in my view). Also, I'll focus on 7-12, because I have reviewed 1-6 before the mid-term.
