# AppliedCryptography
This repo is a review of Applied Cryptography 21fall, NYU Tandon. It's a great course and make sure you have enough time if you wanna register it.
So grateful to professor's(**Giovanni Di Crescenzo, Ph.D.**) help. If you are taking his courses, do not hesitate asking questions.

# Intro
I'll take the final exam 3 days later and I'll document the important topics(in my view). Also, I'll focus on 7-12, because I have reviewed 1-6 before the mid-term.
